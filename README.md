# Weatherly - Simple, Elegant weather

This is a fun project created in [React 16](https://github.com/facebook/react/) with [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), [OpenWeatherMapAPI](https://openweathermap.org/), and [GoogleMapsAPI](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) to show the 5-day weather forecast in an easily digestible format.
